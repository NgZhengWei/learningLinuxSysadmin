/etc/cron.d is a dir for packages to install package specific schedule jobs to prevent package specific schedule jobs
/etc/crontab : the system wide crontab
Creating /etc/cron.allow creates a whitelist of users who are allowed to run cron as bad guys can install a cron process to fetch malware everyday in cron
