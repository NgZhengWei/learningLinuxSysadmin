ISPs can collect and sell your information without consent or informing you.

Virtual Private Networks
- connect 2 networks together using an encrypted tunnel via the internet

Sites without https allows your ISP or anyone to monitor the traffic and see exactly what you're doing.
- with https, they can tell which websites you're visiting but not the pages.

With a VPN, the ISP can only see the VPN server and not the content on the otherside.
- the VPN is like the courier who carries your mail while no VPN is like going to the location physically
- this is known as proxy in networking

ISPs also slow down certain content in favor of others and might dial down your internet speed just to deal with their net traffic.

Take note to force dns traffic through the VPN tunnel too as dns lookups will expose the websites you visit too.
